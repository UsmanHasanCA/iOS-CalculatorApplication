# iOS-CalculatorApplication
At first glance it appears to be a regular calculator, but it has 2 additional features which were made specifically for friends that constantly needed to calculate sales tax/their total on an item after its discounted. They were too lazy to do the math so I made the process as easy as one button click within the calculator.
